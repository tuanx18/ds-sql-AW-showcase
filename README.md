## AdventureWorks Practical SQL Project

**Note**: Taking advantage of the SQL Server's capability to import and open .bak files, I strategically used this feature by employing the AdventureWorks 2022 Database to create a significant project. This project serves as a comprehensive showcase, including a range of SQL commands from fundamental to advanced levels, covering intricate aspects such as Dynamic SQL and user functions.

**Technology**: SQL - SQL Server

**Description**: This initiative utilizes the AdventureWorks 2022 Database as the foundational data source for knowledge acquisition. It is compartmentalized into 20 distinct sections, each designed to cover specific SQL concepts. Within each section, there are 50 SQL requirements, each articulated in a concise format ranging from a single line to a maximum of 50 lines, depending on the complexity of the task. The complexity of requirements intensifies progressively, ensuring comprehensive coverage from foundational to advanced levels. Each requirement is uniquely numbered from 1 to 1000, incorporating distinctive elements to prevent replication.

Despite the fact that many challenges were developed uniquely and that task requirements may have been similar, solving them required a great deal of critical thinking. Furthermore, the BIT, also known as "Booleans" in other programming languages, which are either 1 (True) or 0 (False), also caused some of the very first problems with this section. In combination with the complex use of Subqueries and 'WHERE EXISTS,' this section enhances the problem solving mechanism.
