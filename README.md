Step into my SQL Data Engineering portfolioâ€”an anthology of projects unveiling my finesse in sculpting data landscapes. From intricate models to streamlined processes, witness how I leverage SQL to empower insights and drive transformative solutions in the dynamic world of data engineering

To highlight my proficiency in SQL commands, I have actively engaged in numerous projects that require extensive use of SQL. The primary coding platform for my SQL work is SQL Server, where I have accumulated several years of experience. This section of my portfolio serves as a comprehensive representation of my expertise, covering all aspects of SQL that I have mastered over the years.

Outlined below are the particulars of the pivotal project I have developed:

## Project 1: AdventureWorks Practical SQL Project

Note: Taking advantage of the SQL Server's capability to import and open .bak files, I strategically used this feature by employing the AdventureWorks 2022 Database to create a significant project. This project serves as a comprehensive showcase, including a range of SQL commands from fundamental to advanced levels, covering intricate aspects such as Dynamic SQL and user functions.

Technology: SQL - SQL Server

Description: This initiative utilizes the AdventureWorks 2022 Database as the foundational data source for knowledge acquisition. It is compartmentalized into 20 distinct sections, each designed to cover specific SQL concepts. Within each section, there are 50 SQL requirements, each articulated in a concise format ranging from a single line to a maximum of 50 lines, depending on the complexity of the task. The complexity of requirements intensifies progressively, ensuring comprehensive coverage from foundational to advanced levels. Each requirement is uniquely numbered from 1 to 1000, incorporating distinctive elements to prevent replication.
The following is an exhaustive list detailing each segment of this comprehensive project, along with their respective specifics.

### Part 1: Getting used to beginner level of SQL commands
- URL: 
- Description: This section serves as a foundation for the entire project, focusing on elementary SQL commands like SELECT, WHERE, LIKE, and ORDER BY. Challenges here are concise, typically solvable within five lines of code. While predominantly straightforward, a few tasks introduce beginners to slightly more complex queries involving multiple subqueries and/or CTEs, offering a gentle transition to more intricate SQL operations.
- Length: 50 Problems - 314 Lines
- Main Knowledge Covered: TOP, Subqueries, CTE, Temporary Tables, DATEPART, DATEDIFF, GROUP BY, Aggregate Functions

### Part 2: Diving Deeper into Data Manipulation
- URL: 
- Description: Part 2 marks an elevation in SQL proficiency, delving into an intermediate level of database manipulation. Explore a diverse array of challenges featuring a blend of SQL commands, including GROUP BY, JOIN, HAVING, and complex conditional queries. Tasks vary in complexity, from analyzing data distributions to manipulating multiple datasets through joins and aggregations. This segment aims to solidify foundational knowledge while introducing nuanced SQL operations, laying the groundwork for advanced data querying and analysis.
